					<h3>Bitcoin Ends Inflation</h3>
					<p class="text-left">Bitcoin puts an end to inflation by having a fixed supply of 21 million coins, making it immune to the excessive money printing that devalues traditional currencies. Unlike fiat money, which can be endlessly produced by governments and central banks, Bitcoinâ€™s supply is predetermined by its code. This scarcity ensures that no new Bitcoins can be created after the limit is reached, making it resistant to inflationary pressures. As a result, Bitcoin can maintain its value over time, offering individuals a way to protect their wealth from the eroding effects of inflation.</p>
					<p class="text-left">Rising prices of groceries, housing, and property taxes have significantly impacted Vermonters, making it harder for many to afford basic necessities and maintain a stable quality of life. As grocery costs soar, families are struggling to put food on the table, while skyrocketing housing prices and increased property taxes are pushing homeownership out of reach for many and putting added financial strain on renters. These rising costs are contributing to an overall increase in the cost of living, leaving many Vermonters with tough choices and financial uncertainty.</p>
					<p class="text-left">With Bitcoin, Vermonters can rest easy knowing that their expenses will fall over time, not rise. Having money that holds value makes it easier to save, buy a home, and plan for the future. The economy in Vermont can also become much more efficient, with less focus on finance and banking and more focus on the goods and services Vermonters need.</p>

					<h3>Bitcoin Transforms Retirement Planning</h3>
					<p class="text-left">Currently, Vermonters use tools like bonds, stocks, and real estate to plan for their retirements. However, there are a few fundamental problems with these savings vehicles that make them insecure. First, they all involve a significant amount of trust. Bonds must be repaid by the borrower, stocks are subject to endless risks and require a custodian for ownership, and real estate can be affected by local laws, natural disasters, and depreciation. Second, very few people understand these investments. Unless you are an expert in a specific investment field, you likely need a financial advisor or wealth manager to help you properly invest in the market. This not only adds another layer of trust, but it also introduces an extra expense. Lastly, these investments all have higher volatility and lower liquidity than base money, which makes it difficult to make long-term plans based on their current evaluations.
					<p class="text-left">When using Bitcoin as a base money store of value, retirement planning becomes incredibly simple. All you need to do is save your money, and you will be able to easily structure a plan for the future. Since your money gains value over time instead of losing it, you can be confident that your savings will be able to buy you an equal or greater amount of real goods in a decade compared to what they buy today. This is achieved without having to trust a government, bank, or investment professional, making it a much more efficient strategy. There is nobody to default on you, no CEO who could ruin your portfolio, and no risk of degradation from natural wear and tear. Just good money in your own custody, as it was always meant to be.</p>

					<h3>Bitcoin Empowers a Free and Fair Economy</h3>
					<p class="text-left">Bitcoin creates a fairer economy by decentralizing control of money and eliminating the need for intermediaries like banks. Traditional financial systems often concentrate power in governments or large corporations, which can lead to policies that benefit a few and exclude others. Bitcoin operates on a public blockchain, ensuring transparency and security for all users. It allows anyone with internet access to participate in the economy without needing a bank account, making it especially useful for people in underserved regions. With Bitcoin, individuals can save and transfer wealth without worrying about inflation or hidden fees, helping to level the economic playing field for everyone.</p>
					<p class="text-left">Money is supposed to work for you, not the politicians who issue it. Many people in the working class have been left behind because their wages do not keep pace with inflation. Furthermore, our inflation-based economy naturally incentivizes people to take on excessive debt and limit saving, which inflates the prices of necessities like housing and health care. With sound money, we can create an economy where those who provide the most value for others benefit the most. This dynamic will rejuvenate the working class and reduce the massive wealth inequality we see today.</p>
