              <h3>Our Mission</h3>
              <p class="text-left">At Bitcoin Policy Vermont, we are dedicated to educating the public about the importance of Bitcoin and its potential to transform Vermont’s economy and society.</p>
              <p class="text-left">We believe that Bitcoin represents more than just a technological innovation. It is a new financial paradigm with the power to reshape how we think about money, freedom, and self-sovereignty. Vermont, with its rich history of innovation and community-driven initiatives, is uniquely positioned to lead in this movement. By embracing Bitcoin, we can empower individuals, businesses, and institutions to have greater financial independence, reduce reliance on centralized systems, and foster a more resilient local economy.</p>
              <p class="text-left">Our mission is to bring awareness to the opportunities that Bitcoin presents — whether through financial inclusion for the unbanked, secure savings for families, or the support of small businesses that wish to operate beyond traditional banking constraints. We aim to educate lawmakers, business leaders, and citizens alike about how Bitcoin can protect Vermont's economic future and promote long-term sustainability in an increasingly digital world.</p>
              <p class="text-left">As we look toward the future, Bitcoin Policy Vermont is committed to advocating for sound policies that support Bitcoin’s adoption. By working alongside policymakers, regulators, and Vermont residents, we seek to create a legislative environment that encourages innovation while protecting individual freedoms. Our goal is to ensure that Vermont not only participates in the Bitcoin revolution but thrives because of it.</p>

              <h3>Our Vision</h3>
              <p class="text-left">At Bitcoin Policy Vermont, we envision a future where Bitcoin is seamlessly integrated into the fabric of Vermont’s economy, enhancing both local prosperity and individual financial freedom. In a decade, we see Vermont as a pioneer in digital finance, with Bitcoin serving as a tool for economic resilience, innovation, and sustainability. Farmers, small business owners, and local artisans will use Bitcoin to transact freely, reducing fees and barriers typically associated with traditional banking systems. This decentralized form of currency will empower Vermonters to maintain control over their own wealth, especially in underserved or rural areas where access to financial services has traditionally been limited.</p>
              <p class="text-left">We anticipate that Bitcoin’s decentralized infrastructure will provide Vermont with the tools to build a more self-sufficient economy, less dependent on federal monetary policy and external financial institutions. Municipalities may choose to hold Bitcoin reserves as part of a diversified approach to maintaining fiscal stability, while local governments could accept Bitcoin for taxes and services, giving residents more flexibility in how they manage their finances. This vision of local sovereignty extends to energy production, with Vermont harnessing its renewable resources to power environmentally responsible Bitcoin mining operations, contributing to a more sustainable global network.</p>
              <p class="text-left">In a decade, Vermont will be recognized not just as a hub for natural beauty and agricultural innovation but as a leader in financial freedom, thanks to Bitcoin. We see the state becoming a magnet for entrepreneurs, tech innovators, and Bitcoin-focused businesses who value Vermont’s commitment to independence and progressive policies. Our vision is for Vermont to stand as a model for how communities can use Bitcoin to preserve individual liberty, build stronger local economies, and chart their own financial future.</p>

              <h3>Our Team</h3>
              <p class="text-left">Bitcoin Policy Vermont is a project started by two brothers who grew up in the Chittenden County area. After studying traditional Keynesian economics and working through school, it became clear that there were significant structural problems with how our economic system functions. Growing up after 2008 taught us that some companies and financial institutions can be deemed too big to fail, while the average person bears the costs of their negligence. Our goal is to transform our local economy into one far less reliant on these giant bailouts and big corporations. We want to see Vermont become a prosperous state with robust small businesses and a stable monetary foundation. Bitcoin is our tool to enact change, and we aim to bring our ideas to a larger local stage.</p>
